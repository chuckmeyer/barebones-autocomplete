# Barebones Autocomplete

A few examples of barebones autocomplete implementations. 

## Product example

Load `index.html`. It will pull in Javascript from  `app.js` and styles in `style.css`

## Blog example

Load `onepage-autocomplete.html` -- full blog search experience in one file.

## Webflow example

Add contents of `webflow-autocomplete.html` as a code embed object in your Webflow page. Add a div called "autocomplete" to render the search experience.
